# Repo Goals
> [!Note] This repo is very opinionated to my specific development workflows. This is evident by the use of NeoVim, nix develop, and command line based usage of pio.
> Even with this I will say this is not the development environment I personally am using. My personal development environement "requires" the usage of nix-os. DM me if you are interested in the proper environment.
This repo is meant to create a unified config for working with the (CU-Boulder) ECEN-2360 board. (longan nano)
This is accomplished by the following. 
1. The usage of nix develop allows consistant tools to be used by any party.
2. A simple NeoVim config allows consistent editor completions.
3. Pio allows consistent compilation<sup>*</sup>.
